# Quality Metrics Platform Architecture
## Scope
This document describes only the architecture of the `quality-metrics-platform` repository.

## Component Overview
- **API Layer**: FastAPI application (`src/main.py`) exposing health check, metrics, and admin routers.
- **Routers**:
  - Metric ingestion and retrieval endpoints (`src/routers/metrics.py`)
  - API key management endpoints (`src/routers/admin.py`)
- **Auth Dependencies**:
  - API key extraction/validation (`src/dependencies/auth.py`)
  - Admin authorization checks for protected endpoints
- **Models**: 
  - Pydantic schemas for request/response validation (`src/models/schemas.py`)
  - SQLAlchemy ORM models for database mapping (`src/models/db_models.py`)
- **Database Layer**: 
  - Connection management and session factory (`src/database.py`)
  - Repository layer for teams, projects, and metric persistence (`src/repositories/`)
  - Service layer for business/aggregation logic (`src/services/`)
  - PostgreSQL (via `docker-compose.yml`) with schema in `database/schema.sql` and seed scripts in `database/seed_data.py`
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration via `.env` file (template in `.env.example`)
- **Docs**: Additional architecture notes in `docs/quality-metrics-platform-architecture.md`.

```

## Request Flow
1. Clients POST metric data to the API endpoints (see `src/routers/metrics.py`).
2. FastAPI validates payloads via Pydantic models (`src/models/schemas.py`).
3. Router handlers inject database sessions via dependency injection (`get_db`).
4. Repository/service flow handles:
   - Auto-creation of teams and projects if they don't exist
   - Insertion of metrics into respective tables
   - Querying of aggregated views for analytics
5. The service persists and queries data in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy ORM.
6. Aggregated metrics are retrieved from database views (DORA metrics, defect trends, coverage trends).

## Phase 2 Kickoff Architecture (Current Next Step)

### Integration Slice: GitHub Actions → Deployments Ingestion MVP
- **Goal:** Ingest GitHub Actions workflow run outcomes into existing deployment metrics flow.
- **Primary endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/deployments/github-actions` (new, planned)
- **Auth model:** Bearer API key required for this integration endpoint (team-scoped ingestion key).
- **Mapping strategy:**
  - `repository` → `project_name` (fallback to repo name when no explicit mapping exists)
  - `run_started_at` → `metric_date` (UTC date extraction)
  - `conclusion`/`status` → `successful` (`success` => true, everything else => false for completed runs)
  - optional lead time from payload or derived value when available
- **Persistence path:** Router → `DoraService` → `DeploymentRepository` → `deployment_metrics`
- **Initial constraints (MVP):**
  - Single-event ingestion (no batch mode)
  - No webhook signature verification in MVP
  - Minimal payload contract focused on deployment success/failure + timestamp

### Why This Slice First
- Reuses existing DORA pipeline with minimal schema risk.
- Delivers end-to-end integration value quickly (external source → stored metric → DORA summary).
- Creates the contract pattern to reuse for Jira/coverage integrations.

## Implementation Status
### Completed (Phase 1)
- ✓ Database schema with tables and views
- ✓ Database connection and session management
  - Lazy `DATABASE_URL` validation (prevents tool/test discovery crashes when env is unset)
- ✓ SQLAlchemy ORM models
- ✓ Pydantic request/response schemas
- ✓ Repository + service operations for all metric types
- ✓ API endpoints:
  - POST `/api/v1/deployments` - Ingest deployment metrics
  - POST `/api/v1/deployments/github-actions` - Ingest GitHub Actions workflow deployment events (API key required)
  - POST `/api/v1/defects` - Ingest defect metrics
  - POST `/api/v1/coverage` - Ingest coverage metrics
  - GET `/api/v1/dora-metrics` - Retrieve DORA metrics summary
  - GET `/api/v1/defect-trends` - Retrieve defect trends
  - GET `/api/v1/coverage-trends` - Retrieve coverage trends
  - POST `/api/v1/api-keys` - Create API key (admin)
  - GET `/api/v1/api-keys` - List API keys (admin)
  - DELETE `/api/v1/api-keys/{id}` - Revoke API key (admin)
  - GET `/health` - Health check endpoint
- ✓ Authentication and authorization foundation
  - API key generation, hashing, verification (`src/services/auth_service.py`)
  - Bearer token auth dependencies (`src/dependencies/auth.py`)
  - Admin-only route protection for key management
- ✓ Auto-creation of teams and projects on metric ingestion
- ✓ Environment-based configuration
- ✓ Automated tests and coverage reporting
  - Endpoint tests per route + database module tests
  - Coverage reports written to `coverage_html/`, `coverage.xml`, `coverage.json`
- ✓ Cross-database aggregation for summary endpoints (SQLite tests + PostgreSQL runtime)
  - DORA metrics aggregated via ORM
  - Defect/Coverage trends aggregated in Python (week buckets)
- ✓ Layered test architecture implemented
  - `tests/unit`, `tests/component`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e`
- ✓ Expanded coverage and test depth
  - 106 tests passing
  - 100% line coverage across `src/` modules
  - New unit tests for auth dependencies and main startup branch
- ✓ CRUD module retired (`src/crud.py` removed)
- ✓ VSCode pytest discovery compatibility
  - `tests/conftest.py` ensures repo root is on `sys.path`

### Pending (Future Phases)
- Enforce auth on metric ingestion/retrieval endpoints (currently admin endpoints are protected)
- API versioning and deprecation strategy
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Batch ingestion endpoints
- Data validation rules and constraints
- Visualization dashboard
- Export functionality
- Monitoring and alerting

## Out of Scope
- Personal career plans, learning roadmaps, and non-repository project portfolios.
- Architectures for unrelated projects.
